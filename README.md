# Desktop Composer Workflow for Alfred

[SideNotes](https://www.apptorium.com/sidenotes) is an app that keeps your notes on the side of the screen. Appears when you click a little bar or move your cursor to the screen side. 

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is a powerful app that looks like Spotlight but
has far more features. Besides searching, it offers hotkeys, keywords, text expansions and more.

This workflow lets you quickly switch or create profiles in Desktop Composer — right from Alfred.

## Applying a Profiles (Theme)
```
dc set [profile-name]
```

## Creating New profiles
```
dc new [profile-name]
```
